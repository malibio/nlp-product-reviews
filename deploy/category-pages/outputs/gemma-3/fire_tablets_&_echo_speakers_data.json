    "why_customers_choose": "### **THE Fire Tablets and Echo SpeakersLandscape: AComprehensive Look at Customers Feedback**\n\nRecent customer reviews paint a surprisingly nuanced picture of the Fire Tablets \u2013 particularly the White models \u2013 and the Echo speakers, revealing a mix of enthusiastic praise and some genuine reservations.  Many users are delighted with the convenience of these devices, especially for staying connected while traveling, and expressing their satisfaction with the ease of use and functionality. However, a noticeable segment of respondents expresses frustration with the device\u2019s limitations and suggests improvements are needed.\n\n#### What\u2019s WorkingReally Well:\nCustomers overwhelmingly rave about the Fire tablets\u2019 impressive display quality, boasting a vibrant picture and clear sound, coupled with ample storage options. Many appreciate the ability to easily access ebooks and documents, and the seamless integration with various apps. Furthermore, the fact that the tablets are relatively affordable, with prices ranging from $80-$100, makes them accessible to a broad range of consumers. The inclusion of special offers on the Magenta model further enhances its appeal.\n\n##### The Red Flags ToWatch:\nDespite the generally positive sentiment, several customers voiced concerns regarding the Fire Tablet\u2019s limited functionality. Some reported difficulty navigating certain apps, a lack of offline capabilities, and a frustrating experience when trying to connect to Wi-fi. Several reviewers also noted that the battery life could be improved, lasting less than expected.\n\n<h4>My Recommendation:</h4>\nUltimately, the Fire Tabs and Echo speakers represent a solid entry point into digital reading and audio entertainment. If you prioritize a large screen, easy access to books and media, and value affordability, the White Fire Tablets are a worthwhile investment. However if you require robust offline functionality or extensive app compatibility, you might want to consider alternatives.\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\n\n \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0b86\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b86\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bc1. \u0b86\u0ba9\u0bbe \u0b86\u0ba9\u0bbe.\u0b86\u0ba9\u0bbe \u0b86\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bcd. \u0b86\u0bae\u0bbe..\u0bbe.\u0baa\u0bb4\u0bc8\u0baf.\u0baa\u0bbe",

        "text": "UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more",

        "text": "The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",

The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.br /br /The so-so:br /The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more",

        "text": "I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes.",
