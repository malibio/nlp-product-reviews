    "why_customers_choose": "### **THE FIRE TV & STREAMING DEVICES LANDSCAPE: A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT CUSTOMER FEEDBACK**\n\nRecent customer reviews paint a nuanced picture of the Fire TV and streaming device market \u2013 a landscape brimming with potential, yet currently grappling with some persistent usability challenges.  Many users are clearly impressed by the Fire TVs\u2019 ability to seamlessly integrate with their existing devices and offer a robust library of content, particularly when paired with the included accessories. However, a significant number express frustration with the core functionality, specifically the handling of PDF files and the intrusive advertising displayed within the browser.\n\n#### What's Being Done Right:\nThe certified refurbished Amazon Fire TVs (particularly the Previous Generation -1st) consistently receive high praise for their performance and value. Users frequently highlight the ease of setup and the impressive selection of compatible apps, making them a compelling option for those seeking a budget-friendly way to enjoy digital media. The inclusion of the HDMI cable and power adapter further enhances the user experience, simplifying the initial connection process.\n\n##### The Red Flags To Watch:\nDespite the generally positive reception, several customers report difficulties with the device\u2019s PDF reader. Many find that the automatic enlargement simply enlarges pages without intelligently resizing documents, leading to frustrating navigation and an inability to easily advance through lengthy texts. Furthermore, a recurring complaint centers around the aggressive display of advertisements within the Amazon browser, disrupting the reading experience and diminishing the overall enjoyment of the device.\n\n<h4>My Recommendation:</h4>\nA Fire TV stick is a solid choice for casual viewers looking for a cost-effective entry point into streaming services. However if you regularly work with PDFs or are sensitive to intrusive advertising, consider exploring alternatives like a dedicated e-reader or a more streamlined tablet device. If you prioritize a large screen and extensive app support, the Fire Television remains a viable option, but be prepared to potentially invest in additional accessories to address the PDF reader limitations.jenoSniper\nrappro",

        "text": "I originally purchased the Paper White and after a week of that, I decided to upgrade to the Voyage for a couple reasons. 1) Perhaps my phone has made me lazy but I've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. It's something that I don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. The Voyage is currently the only Kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. I've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. I humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. For instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the Kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. I have had NO problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the Kindle. It's brilliant.2) Page turn haptic buttons. These are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, I simply squeeze. I do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as I find I've needed to adjust my grip lower than I normally would have held on to the device. It's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) The flush screen. This makes a big difference to me - I was not a fan of the recessed screen on the Paper White and even the Nook has a flush screen! Amazon really needs to introduce waterproof Kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. This is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the Paper White and I've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the Voyage has a glass screen, while the Paper White has plastic? I'm not sure, but the ONLY time I notice this is when I'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. I may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) The general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the Paper White. This also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the Paper White, which is always a good thing.To recap - This is the ONLY Kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the Oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the Paper White.",
