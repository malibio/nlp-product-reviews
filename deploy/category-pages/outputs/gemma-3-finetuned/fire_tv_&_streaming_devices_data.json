Recent customer feedback reveals a mixed bag \u2013 while many appreciate the Fire TV stick\u2019s core functionality and its ability to seamlessly integrate with Amazon services, several users express frustration with its performance when handling larger files, particularly PDFs.  Conversely, a significant number are delighted with the Fire Television itself, praising its ease of use and overall value proposition, especially considering it offers a cost-effective entry point into the world of digital reading.\n\n#### What's Being Done Right:\nUsers consistently praise the Fire Stick\u2019s ability to stream video content from Amazon Prime Video and other compatible services. The device\u2019s simple interface and straightforward operation make it incredibly accessible, and the built-in Alexa integration adds a convenient layer of voice control.  Furthermore, the Fire television\u2019s refresh rate is generally well-received, contributing to a smoother viewing experience compared to older models.  Many reviewers highlight the device\u2019*s ability for quick access to content within the Amazon ecosystem, streamlining the user experience considerably.\n\n##### The Challenges to Consider:\nA recurring theme among negative feedback centers around the Fire\u2019s struggles with PDF files. Users frequently report that the device fails to adequately enlarge pages or resize documents, rendering them difficult to read and navigate.  Additionally, numerous users have expressed annoyance with the persistent display of advertisements within the browser, suggesting a need for improved ad management and potentially a more robust ad-blocking solution.  Some users also noted that the FireTV\u2019s auto-brightness feature isn\u2019t always reliable, leading to inconsistent brightness levels.\n\n<h4>My Recommendation:</h4>\nUltimately, the best choice depends on individual needs and priorities. If you primarily consume Amazon Prime video content and prioritize simplicity, the certified refurbished Fire TV Stream is an excellent",

        "text": "I originally purchased the Paper White and after a week of that, I decided to upgrade to the Voyage for a couple reasons. 1) Perhaps my phone has made me lazy but I've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. It's something that I don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. The Voyage is currently the only Kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. I've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. I humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. For instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the Kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. I have had NO problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the Kindle. It's brilliant.2) Page turn haptic buttons. These are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, I simply squeeze. I do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as I find I've needed to adjust my grip lower than I normally would have held on to the device. It's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) The flush screen. This makes a big difference to me - I was not a fan of the recessed screen on the Paper White and even the Nook has a flush screen! Amazon really needs to introduce waterproof Kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. This is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the Paper White and I've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the Voyage has a glass screen, while the Paper White has plastic? I'm not sure, but the ONLY time I notice this is when I'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. I may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) The general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the Paper White. This also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the Paper White, which is always a good thing.To recap - This is the ONLY Kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the Oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the Paper White.",
