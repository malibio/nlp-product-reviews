    "why_customers_choose": "### **The Fire TV & Streaming Devices Landscape: A Comprehensive Look at Customer Feedback**\nDiving into the customer sentiment around Amazon's streaming and reading devices reveals a generally positive reception, particularly regarding ease of use and suitability as gifts. However, the picture isn't entirely without its snags, with users pointing out specific areas ripe for improvement. It seems the upgrade path within the Amazon ecosystem is a well-appreciated route for existing users.\n### **What's Working Really Well:**\nCustomers are clearly happy with these devices for their core functions. Many see them as fantastic gift options, readily enjoyed by recipients. There's strong evidence that upgrading from previous generations is a satisfying experience, bringing noticeable improvements that users love. For those looking for a dedicated reading experience, these devices are considered a great alternative to more general-purpose tablets, suggesting they excel at focused tasks. The overall sentiment indicates that users find the devices highly likeable and effective for their intended purposes.\n### **The Red Flags to Watch:**\nOn the flip side, there are some notable pain points. Navigating certain file types, specifically PDF files, proves challenging, with devices failing to resize documents properly for easy reading progression. The integrated browser functionality is called out as needing significant improvement, indicating it's not a strong suit for users who might want to do more than just basic browsing. Furthermore, the presence of pop-up advertisements is a source of irritation that customers feel Amazon should address. While generally liked, one user noted the price felt high \"for what it is.\"\n### **My Recommendation:**\nSo, who should jump into the Amazon device pool? If you're looking for a reliable, user-friendly streaming solution or a dedicated e-reader, especially if you're upgrading from an older model or buying a gift, these devices, including the Certified Refurbished Fire TV Stick which is a top product, are likely a solid bet. They perform their primary functions well and are generally well-loved. However, if you plan on heavy web browsing directly on the device, need seamless support for various document formats like PDFs, or are particularly sensitive to intrusive ads, you might want to explore other options or manage your expectations. Consider your core use case carefully against the highlighted concerns.",

        "text": "I originally purchased the Paper White and after a week of that, I decided to upgrade to the Voyage for a couple reasons. 1) Perhaps my phone has made me lazy but I've grown accustomed to auto-brightness. It's something that I don't even really think of at all... until you have to manually adjust it. The Voyage is currently the only Kindle that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen. I've read reviews that question the efficacy of it, and those people tend to say it's hit or miss. I humbly submit that that is because it's a 'smart' auto-brightness that adjusts to your preferences at certain light levels. For instance if you're in a dimly lit room and the screen is too bright for you there, and you manually turn it down a few notches the next time you're in that room, the Kindle will remember what your screen brightness preference was at that light level and adjust. I have had NO problems with this feature and consider it the most indispensable feature on the Kindle. It's brilliant.2) Page turn haptic buttons. These are great, and allow me to not need to move my hand at all to turn a page, I simply squeeze. I do wish they had been placed slightly higher on the device as I find I've needed to adjust my grip lower than I normally would have held on to the device. It's very nice having the option to not need to swipe the page to turn it.3) The flush screen. This makes a big difference to me - I was not a fan of the recessed screen on the Paper White and even the Nook has a flush screen! Amazon really needs to introduce waterproof Kindles and a flush screen is going to be necessary for that. This is also my only negative about the device - the screen appears to be slightly more reflective than the Paper White and I've heard (wether it's true or not) that is because the Voyage has a glass screen, while the Paper White has plastic? I'm not sure, but the ONLY time I notice this is when I'm reading the the sun is directly behind me. I may need to tilt the screen 5 degrees in any direction and it's easily readable again.4) The general design is sleeker and feels better in my hand than the Paper White. This also allows the device to be slightly lighter than the Paper White, which is always a good thing.To recap - This is the ONLY Kindle to feature the auto-brightness feature (not even the Oasis has it--probably to save on weight) and in my opinion a worthy upgrade over the Paper White.",
