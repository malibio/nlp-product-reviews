        "text": "Finally received the Kindle Lighted Leather Cover for the newest version Kindle. It is VERY lightweight and I had to double and triple check the description considering it states this is a leather cover. The front cover is very thin with a medium-weight cardboard feel to it. The leather on the front cover is extremely thin and you can immediately tell the surface will be easily scratched and marred with normal everyday use. The inside of the front cover has a thin microfiber material to protect the screen. The back cover is hollowed out plastic to form-fit your Kindle and snaps in with relative ease.Using the enclosed graphic instruction card, I removed the Kindle as shown, having to use just enough pressure to make me a bit concerned for someone who would place and remove their Kindle in this cover frequently. However, I plan on using this cover as a full-time solution for both protection and as a light source.I went ahead and pulled up a book and switched the light on, heading to a closet to see how this looked in complete darkness. The light pulls out of the back cover and is nice and stiff and has a locked full-out position. The spread of the light is greater on top obviously but it does reach the entire screen on the Kindle. There was no glare or reflection and I was able to easily read the page without any noticeable straining.If I were to choose between this design and the Kindle Keyboard lighted cover, which I have used since its release, I would choose this newer cover.Read more",

        "text": "I owned a Kindle Keyboard for about a year, and I purchased the leather lighted case for that unit. While the corner light left a little to be desired as far as even lighting, overall I was very pleased with the case. Based on that experience, I went ahead and purchased the lighted cover for my new Kindle. I can't say this experience has as been as positive.Let's start off with what's good about the case. The Kindle battery powered light is a big improvement. The light is now centered on the screen, so illumination is more even now. I don't use the light often, but in the cases where I do it will be nice to have more balanced coverage. One positive on the case itself is that I appreciate how much lighter this one feels than the previous generation. The hinge area is smaller, which means less of the spine folding effect the other one took on after heavy use. I never took my Kindle Keyboard out of the case after it was put in, so the snug fit I have seen complaints about is not an issue for me. It IS tight, though, so if you don't plan to keep the case on full time be aware it may take some effort to get it back out. In my situation, that tight fit is exactly what I want, but your mileage may vary.Now on to the negatives. The case does feel very cheap, especially with no change in price point. The previous cover felt like a solidly made piece of work, whereas the new cover only feels half as sturdy. The thinness of the case was no doubt done to minimize its weight, so I realize this is a personal issue. Outside the thickness, though, it just doesn't look or feel as well made. The textured surface of the previous model you that leather feel, very much like a real book. Finally, the most stunning oversight is the lack of a closure device.Read more",

        "text": "I purchased this Kindle case in the Saddle Tan color. The leather is high quality (it has that wonderful new smell as well) and has beautiful stitching around the border on the front. The case does not add any bulk to the Kindle. I find it quite comfortable to hold in one hand or two, as the front cover folds behind the case, and I truly feel like I am holding an actual book while reading.At the top of the case, there is a plastic arm that pulls upward to reveal a light, which illuminates the screen of the Kindle perfectly in a dark room. My eyes have no trouble reading with the light activated. The light is powered by the Kindle itself, by way of two metal prongs inside the case making contact with two metal tabs on the lower back of the Kindle. The arm for the light does seem a bit delicate, and I could see a young child inadvertently breaking this if care is not shown. I fear that over time, this will be the first piece to stop functioning as the case is regularly used.My only criticism of this case is that there is no way to secure the front cover from opening. It would have been nice to include a clasp, or some kind of stretchable band to keep the case closed. I paid 54 for this case, which is almost as expensive as the Kindle itself. At that price, the designers should have had the forethought to include a means of securing the case from opening. Aside from this potential problem, this Kindle case is perfect, and adds a bit of sophistication to an already awesome device.Kudos, Amazon!",
