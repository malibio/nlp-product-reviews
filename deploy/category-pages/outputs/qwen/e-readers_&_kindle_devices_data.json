Why couldn't they just leave the home page showing the small pictures of the books you bought? I have no idea what My Reading List is - it lists books I've never heard of, by authors and topics of which I have no interest. Still, I would recommend a Kindle to anyone who reads books. The screen is easy to read, you can make the fonts bigger or smaller. I don't feel the battery lasts any longer than my old one did, but it's easy to charge. It's thin and lightweight, and I pretty much carry my Kindle wherever I go. Anyone who buys a Kindle will definitely NOT be disappointed!!!",
